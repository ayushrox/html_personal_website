    <h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>Multi Object Tracking using Faster RCNN and IOU Tracker</h3></li>
    <p>This project was completed as the term paper for the Machine Learning course. In this project, I implemented a Multi Object Tracker using Pytorch. </p>
    <li><h3>Inland waterways Aids to Navigation using Sediment Prediction</h3></li>
    <p>This project was completed at Maritime Research Centre, Pune as a Summer Research Intern. Machine Learning models were implemented to help in crafting an algorithm to predict sediment levels in rivers.</p>
    <li><h3>Solar Cells for energy Harvesting in IoT Circuits</h3></li>
    <p>This project was completed as a Study Project, where I implemented various DC-DC convertors in Simulink along with different MPPT algorithms.</p>
